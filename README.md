# visibility-polygon
A project that aims at finding the visibility polyhedron of a point situated on the ground when viewed from a particular altitude above the ground level. A visibility polyhedron is a 3-dimensional structure that specifies the space from where the point to be monitored can be viewed without any obstruction. The polyhedron also takes care of the field of view of the camera that is used to monitor the point.
